    <h1>Nathaly M. Rivera</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to my website! I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of 
      Economics at the University of Chile. My research and teaching interests 
      are Environmental and Resource Economics, Energy Economics, and Applied 
      Econometrics. One of my research strands lies in the intersection between 
      market capitalizations of environmental (dis)amenities and the evaluation 
      of environmental policy, with a focus on air pollution. The other one 
      focuses on the economics of extractive industries, particularly on their
      impact on local welfare.
